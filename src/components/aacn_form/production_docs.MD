# AACN FORMS 

_An easy to use react component for generating forms_


## Production Notes 

+ The basic implementation will be to generate the form through using a function,  we will pass as arguments our form conifguration and the DOM node on which we wish to mount our form.eg.
eg.
   ` createForm( *configurationObject* , *DOMnode* )  //  Form will be generated and mounted onto our page 

+ ASP.NET core version of CRA. Manually Updated react-scripts, react, and bootstrap
